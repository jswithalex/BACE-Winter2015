## Review of Concepts

#### Data Types

Primitive Data Types: 

+ numbers
+ string 
+ boolean

Object Types:

+ Array
+ Function
+ Object

#### Mutability / Immutability

All primitive data types are immutable. 

If a variable is immutable, that means it is 'read-only', or that the operation of updating its value while retaining its 'identity' (location in memory) is not supported.  You can reassign a primitive variable a new value, but the variable will now point to newly created value in a different location than the variable pointed to last.

All Object Types are mutable.  

This means that if you update a property on an object, the object itself retains its identity (same location in memory).
