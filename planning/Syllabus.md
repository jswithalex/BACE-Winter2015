#### Week 1
+ **exercise**: create HTML with javascript
+ why javascript? 
  well, 
  + html provides the basic elements for a web page.
  + css provides the styling
  + javascript allows us to 
    + control user interaction with the various features of our web page
    + write complex application logic to handle the aforementioned events with some fine-grained control.


THE DOM
  + [Dom Ref: MZ Dev Netwk](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
  + In short: The Dom 'makes web pages accessible to script' (above).
  + There is very important fourth element in our client-side picture so far. The DOM (document object model).  This is a model of the html page as it exists after being integrated into the browser. 
  
  + The Story: 
    + we request a page from a web server specified at the link we put into our web browser.
    + the web server responds to our request by sending us back an HTML document
    + our web browser gets this document and builds a big model of what the text represents to your browser.  With     this model, you can programmatically access the html elements.
    + TAKEAWAY: How much functionality is handled on the endpoints of this client-server communication model?
    My answer: most of it.  The html data is pretty light compared to what the web browsers themselves do.  
+ exploring the javascript console: selecting elements, changing their properties
+ javascript language basics: numbers, strings, true/false, arrays, expressions, statements

#### Week 2
+ **exercise**: form validation with html forms
+ writing html with javascript: DOM operations
+ composite data types: working with arrays
+ control flow mechanisms: for loops, if/else
