## Introduction

What is this Course?

+ We will do a series of small, focused projects that extend a web page with JavaScript.  
+ 

#### Why JavaScript?
  + HTML provides the basic elements for a web page. When the browser reads these, it creates a corresponding object.
  + with html5, a lot more sophisticated and convenient features are built-in to the browser.
  + CSS provides the styling with new sophisticated capabilities
  + javascript allows us to exert fine-grained logical control over user and system interactions. This is an abstract way of putting it, so here's an example:  say you're a newspaper and in your website's literature reviews you want to let the user get the definition of a word by hovering over it for a certain length of time.  With JavaScript, you can intercept a hover event that the user initiates with a mouse
  
#### THE JavaScript Environment
+ The Client-Server Story: 
    + we request a page from a web server specified at the link we put into our web browser.
    + the web server responds to our request by sending us back an HTML document
    + our web browser gets this document, parses it and creates a model from it that we program against/for. and builds a big model of what the text represents to your browser.  With     this model, you can programmatically access the html elements.
    + TAKEAWAY: How much functionality is handled on the endpoints of this client-server communication model?
    My answer: most of it.  The html data is pretty light compared to what the web browsers themselves do.  
+ exploring the javascript console: selecting elements, changing their properties
+ javascript language basics: numbers, strings, true/false, arrays, expressions, statements

  #### JavaScript accesses the Web Browser via an interface called the DOM.  The DOM is a structure that holds the HTML information as it is 
  + [Dom Ref: MZ Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
  + In short: The Dom 'makes web pages accessible to script' (above).
  + There is very important fourth element in our client-side picture so far. The DOM (document object model).  This is a model of the html page as it exists after being integrated into the browser. 
  
  
#### Week 2
+ **exercise**: form validation with html forms
+ writing html with javascript: DOM operations
+ composite data types: working with arrays
+ control flow mechanisms: for loops, if/else



#### Week 3
