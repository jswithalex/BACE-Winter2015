#### Week 1
+ **exercise**: create HTML with javascript
+ why javascript? 
  well, 
  + html provides the basic elements for a web page.
  + css provides the styling
  + we need a language that can manipulate objects depending on certain states that exist in the browser.
  + There is a little more to it.  There is a model that lets us hook into browser's internal events.  It's called the **DOM**, or Document Object Model.  
  + The Story: 
    + we request a page from a web server specified at the link we put into our web browser.
    + the web server responds to our request by sending us back an HTML document
    + our web browser gets this document and builds a big model of what the text represents to your browser.  With     this model, you can programmatically access the html elements.
    + TAKEAWAY: How much functionality is handled on the endpoints of this client-server communciation model?
    My answer: most of it.  The DOM is a representation of the HTML elements you received as they are made sense of     by your browser's environment.
+ exploring the javascript console: selecting elements, changing their properties
+ javascript language basics: numbers, strings, true/false, arrays, expressions, statements
