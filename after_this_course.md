#### Node.js

Node.js is a server-side implementation of JavaScript that lets you write code to run on your system.  
If you want to build a website entirely with JavaScript, you can do this in a Node environment with a web framework like Express.js and a templating library like Underscore.js.
The idea is that you use the Express framework to handle incoming resource requests and respond with templates compiled by Underscore.

#### HTML5 Canvas

The HTML5 canvas is a great improvement in the HTML specification that provides you with a fairly straightforward way to make animations and games inside the browser.  You need to include a canvas tag, and the rest of the game can be built with JavaScript.
