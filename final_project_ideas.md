Project Ideas
=============
1. make a persistent to-do list with the html5 local storage API (so that when you leave the web page and come back, the to-do list items are still there).
2. a full-page subway map that highlights the routes you want
3. a card-matching game
4. a portfolio site
5. Take any project we worked on and improve it (e.g., for form validation, you could implement [these](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/27/form-field-validation-errors-only-approach/) suggestions.)
