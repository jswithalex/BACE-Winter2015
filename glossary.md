#### Glossary of JavaScript Terms

**Variable**: A name for the value at a particular **location** in memory.  The value of a variable is subject to change, which is why variables are useful.

```javascript
var a = 14;
// 'a' is the name that the JavaScript engine uses to look up a location in memory
// we access the value of 'a' by referencing 'a' in an expression, like the one below
console.log(a);
// 

```

**String**: A sequence of characters

```javascript
var f = 'Douglas';
var l = 'Crockford';
typeof f
// "string"
```
