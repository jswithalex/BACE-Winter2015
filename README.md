## Programming with JavaScript and jQuery
### Course Description:

Websites today are no longer a collection of static pages; they behave more like desktop applications, responding to user interaction in a complex way. This increased functionality means that JavaScript, the programming language of the browser, is more important than ever. This project-based course will teach you how to turn your HTML pages into dynamic, application-like interfaces with JavaScript and jQuery. 

#### Pre-Requisites:

+ A working knowledge of HTML and CSS and familiarity with the internet. 
+ Create a GitHub account to save your work on the web.
