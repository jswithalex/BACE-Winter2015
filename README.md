## Programming with JavaScript and jQuery

Websites today are no longer a collection of static pages; they behave more like desktop applications, responding to user interaction in a complex way. This increased functionality means that JavaScript, the programming language of the browser, is more important than ever. This project-based course will teach you how to turn your HTML pages into dynamic, application-like interfaces with JavaScript and jQuery.
